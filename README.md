# Cosmo Bouncer

Cosmo Bouncer is an app to explain a little about gravity and encourage children to discover it. It shows in a simple way the differences between the gravities of the planets, how a body with mass interacts differently with each planet.

This app was made for WWDC 2023 and was one of the selected apps.
